# CRUD Superheroes with Angular 15 & .NET 6 ðŸš€ Web API, EF Core & SQL Server

This is a web application that allows you to perform CRUD operations on a list of superheroes. The frontend of the application is built using Angular 15, while the backend is built using .NET 6 Web API with EF Core and SQL Server.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- .NET 6 SDK
- Node.js
- Sql server express
- Angular CLI

- Visual Studio
- visual Studio Code

You will also need a SQL Server instance or connection string to a remote SQL Server database.
